# Copaint
Copaint is a basic project to practice networking in C++. It was created after following along on a [network tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hNdkYInj4g), [SFML tutorials](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/) and borrowing someone's implementation of Bresenham's line algorithm.
